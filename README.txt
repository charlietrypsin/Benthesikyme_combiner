The combiner works to combine a set of text files of collision induced unfolding in a directory to 
a format that can be used by Benthesikyme [1].

Run using the following command:

python combiner.py [directory], [name of combine output], [start (eg.) voltage], [end voltage],
[increment between voltage steps]

The combined file will outputted into the directory. If the increments are not uniform the values
can be altered in the text file accordingly.
